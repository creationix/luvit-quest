# luvit-quest
An interactive workshop that teaches network programming with luvit.


## Tracks

There are two main tracks for adventurers to choose, they are node-style and coro-style.  The noode-style teaches the APIs in luvit 1.x which mirror the APIs in node.js.  The coro-style is a new style that uses coroutines to block on I/O without blocking the thread itself so that the event loop can continue to run.

## Basic Progression

In either style, the progression will be the same, players will learn skills that enable them to earn achievements that contain keys to later quests.

For example, here is a sample level:

Initial Tools:

HTTP Client URL - Used to notify dungeon master server your server is ready to be tested.
HTTP Server Docs - Link to API docs to creating HTTP server
